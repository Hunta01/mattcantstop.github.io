## GoodBye Facebook ##
I haven't had Facebook for a while now. However, there were many good discussions that I had on Facebook that I really enjoyed. I am going to use this blog to discuss topics that interest me. These are mostly programming and religion. My mom said that since I ditched Facebook she has missed the frequent updates on what's happening. Hopefully this will help remedy that. 

I have written this blog in Jekyll. It is a way to keep static text files for writing a blog while being able to user partials and Markdown. I am enjoying it so far.

Check out the [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/) for more info on Jekyll.
